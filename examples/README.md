# Agentican Examples

Forty self-contained programs that demonstrate Agentican across real-world
domains and complexity levels. Each example picks a concrete business
scenario, shows the minimum framework surface needed to solve it, and runs
end-to-end from a single `main()`.

## Layout

```
examples/src/main/java/ai/agentican/framework/examples/
├── notools/
│   ├── agents/              ← single-agent tasks (agentTask)
│   │   └── hitl/            ← single-agent + human-in-the-loop
│   └── workflows/           ← multi-step plans (workflowTask)
│       └── hitl/            ← multi-step + HITL on an intermediate step
└── withtools/               ← plans that call external tools via Composio
```

The layout is a progressive-disclosure path:

- **`notools/` vs `withtools/`** — `notools` examples need only an LLM key.
  No external credentials, no side effects, safe to run locally. `withtools`
  examples integrate real services (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.) through
  Composio and need both API keys plus connected accounts.
- **`agents/` vs `workflows/`** — An *agent task* is a single LLM call with
  typed input and output — the simplest surface. A *workflow task* is a
  multi-step plan (sequential, branch, loop) where steps pass output to each
  other. Workflows show orchestration.
- **`hitl/` subdirectories** — Human-in-the-loop examples are isolated
  because they require interactive stdin. They wire a `CliHitlNotifier` onto
  `Agentican.builder().hitlManager(...)` and either prompt for step-output
  approval or answer an in-agent `ASK_QUESTION`.

## Running

Every example reads its config from classpath YAML. Required env vars:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required by every example.
- `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, `COMPOSIO_USER_ID` — required by `withtools/` examples
  only, plus the relevant integrations connected in your Composio account.

A `.env` file at the repo root (or any parent) is picked up automatically.

Run from the IDE (each file has a `main()`) or from Maven:

```bash
mvn -pl examples exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=ai.agentican.framework.examples.notools.agents.AlertReview
```

## HITL at a glance

Agentican supports three checkpoint types, all demonstrated in the `hitl/`
subdirectories:

- **`STEP_OUTPUT`** — fires after a step with `hitl: true` completes. The
  human approves (step becomes `COMPLETED`) or rejects with feedback (the
  framework re-runs the step with the feedback appended, up to
  `maxStepRetries`). Each retry creates its own approval checkpoint.
- **`QUESTION`** — fires when an agent invokes the `ASK_QUESTION` tool
  mid-execution. The human answers, the agent resumes with the answer, and
  eventually produces a step output.
- **`TOOL_CALL`** — fires when a tool marked as HITL-required is about to be
  invoked. Approve to let the tool run; reject to surface a rejection to
  the agent.

`CliHitlNotifier` is a reference `HitlNotifier` that reads and writes stdin.
Swap it for any notifier — Slack, a web UI, a test harness — and framework
behavior is identical.
